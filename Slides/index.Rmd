## Introduction

Play Rock-Paper-Scissors here:
https://njungenfelt.shinyapps.io/Shiny

If you're not familiar with this classic game - here are the rules:

## The application 
The code for the Shiny app is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/njungenfelt/DevDataProd

The user interface consists of three buttons (rock, paper, scissor) that the player clicks on. On each click, the server reactively generates it's own throw. The throws are compared and displayed in the output data table in the main panel. The latest game always appear at the top of the table.

Scores are kept in the standings column in the form `p-t-c`, where `p` is the count for human wins, `t` is the number of ties, and `c` is the count for computer wins.

Behind the scenes, throws are stored as 1 for rock, 2 for paper, and 3 for scissors. The winner is then determined by

$x_i \gets (p_i-c_i) \mod{} 3\hspace{4em}$     (The mod operator corresponds to `%%` in R)

where $p_i$ is the throw of the player, and $c_i$ is the throw of the computer. Then, it's a tie if $x_i=0$, the human player won if $x_i=1$ and the computer won if $x_i=2$.

## Game strategy
The strategy of the computer is just random number generation:
```{r}
throw <- function(history) {
    id <- sample(1:3,1)
    return(id)
}
```
The seed is set using `Sys.time()` to make sure the pattern is not the same each session. Here is an example use of the function:
```{r}
set.seed(as.integer(Sys.time()))
throw()
```

## Further improvements
The `throw()` function on the previous slide has an input argument `history` that is never used. This was to highlight further development for this project including making the computer "smart".

Under the assumtion that a human player does not mimic a random number generator very well, it should be possible to create a learning algorithm that beats most humans in the long run.
